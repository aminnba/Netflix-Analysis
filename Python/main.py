### Country Movie Distribution Analysis:

- **United States** has the highest number of movies in the dataset, which is expected considering the domination of the entertaiment field, It also indicats its strong influence in global movie production and distribution.
- **India** comes in second place, which is intresting as we can see the Bollywood scean strong production , **United Kingdom**, and **Canada** are also major players in the entertainment industry, contributing to a wide range of genres.
- **France** and **Germany** appear in the top ranks, showing their significant role in European cinema.
- Countries like **Romania**, **Portugal**, and **New Zealand** appear lower in the list, which could suggest smaller or emerging film industries.
- In conclusion,We can see that the United States is the most dominant country in the entertainment industry by a big margin, then other countries like India, France, Germany, and Romania are also prominent.

### Missing Data & Data Cleaning

- **Missing Data**: 
    - I identified that the dataset has some missing values in columns such as `director`, `cast`, and `country`. These are important columns for understanding the movies in terms of their creators and origin.
    - Filling missing values with "Unknown" allows us to keep the dataset intact without dropping potentially useful data, ensuring we can still perform meaningful analysis.

- **Data Cleaning**:
    - We converted the `date_added` column to datetime format, which allows us to extract more useful insights such as the year and month a movie was added.
    - This is important because trends over time are easier to observe when the data is in the correct format.

- **Conclusion**:
    - After cleaning the dataset, we now have a reliable dataset to work with, free from the issues that would arise from missing data. This process sets the stage for deeper analyses of trends and patterns over time .

- **Next Step**: With the cleaned data, we can start to analyze trends in movies over time

### Analysis: Number of Movies Added Each Year
print("""
**Goal:** To identify trends in the number of movies added to the database over the years.

1. **Tools Used:**
   - **Pandas**: For loading and manipulating the data.
   - **Matplotlib**: For generating the bar chart.

2. **Approach:**
   - We extracted the year from the `date_added` column to determine when each movie was added to the database.
   - A bar chart was created to visualize the number of movies added per year.

3. **Results:**
   - The chart shows the distribution of movies added over the years, with clear peaks and troughs, indicating varying levels of content being added across different periods.
4. **Conclusion:**
   - We can see from the chart that there 2008 had the most movies added, that can be attributed to the introduction of the streaming service, allowing subscribers to instantly watch television shows and movies on their personal computers.
As part of this transition, Netflix added a large number of titles to its platform around 2008 and started aggressively acquiring licenses for movies and TV shows to grow its streaming library. This period marked Netflixâ€™s shift from a DVD rental company to a streaming giant, necessitating a larger library to attract users to the streaming service.

1. **Tools Used:**
   - **Pandas**: For filtering and analyzing the data.
   - **Matplotlib**: For generating the bar chart.

2. **Approach:**
   - First, we filtered out the entries where the director was marked as 'Unknown'.
   - We used `value_counts()` to count the number of movies directed by each director.
   - A bar chart was plotted to visualize the top 10 directors with the most movies.

3. **Results:**
   - The chart shows the top 10 directors, with each director's total number of movies clearly displayed.
   - Some directors consistently have a high number of movies in the dataset, which could indicate prolific careers or a particular focus on specific genres or platforms.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - We observe that Rajiv chilaka is the top director with the most movies, He is the CEO and founder of GreenGold animation which direct and produce various indian movies, that can corelate with the number of movies comming from india checked ealier, next we have Jan Suter, Raul Campos and on and on. 
   - The data provides insights into the most active directors, which could be useful for further analysis on their styles, genres, or the distribution of their works across different platforms.

   - The data was then exploded, meaning each genre for a movie was treated as a separate entry.
   - A frequency count of the top 10 most popular genres was performed.

3. **Results:**
   - The bar chart displays the 10 most common genres, indicating their popularity within the dataset.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most popular genres indicate a diverse offering, with genres like Dramas as the most popular, Comedies, then action and adventures dominating the dataset. This reflects a general audience preference for these categories and the kinds of movies that are most frequently produced or acquired by the platform.

**Goal:** To analyze the distribution of movie durations in the dataset.

1. **Tools Used:**

2. **Approach:**
   - The `duration` column was converted from a string format (e.g., "90 min") to a numeric value (minutes) using string extraction.
   - A histogram was plotted to visualize the frequency of movies based on their duration.

3. **Results:**
   - The histogram reveals that most movies tend to have a duration between 80 and 120 minutes, with the frequency declining for movies longer than 100 minutes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The data indicates that the majority of movies in the dataset are within the 80-120 minute range, which aligns with industry norms for feature films.

**Goal**: To analyze the average duration of movies based on their ratings to see if there is a trend between content ratings and movie lengths.

1. **Tools Used**:
   - **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
   - **Matplotlib**: For generating the bar chart.

2. **Approach**:
   - We cleaned the `rating` column by ensuring that only valid ratings were included, removing any numeric entries that might have been misinterpreted as ratings (e.g., 66 min).
   - We then calculated the average movie duration for each valid rating.
   - A bar chart was created to visualize the average duration of movies based on their rating.

3. **Results**:
   - The ratings NC-17 and UR (Unrated) have the longest average movie durations, with NC-17 exceeding 120 minutes.
   - PG-13 and R-rated movies have similar average durations, with UR movies slightly longer than PG-13.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Movies with the NC-17 rating tend to be longer on average, potentially due to more mature or complex content requiring additional runtime.
   - The similarity in duration between PG-13, R, and UR movies suggests that mainstream movies for older audiences generally fall within a certain duration range.
   - This analysis highlights possible trends between content maturity and movie runtime, but more investigation would be needed to understand the factors influencing this pattern.
